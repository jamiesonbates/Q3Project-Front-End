## Description
This.City is a crowd sourcing platform for reporting problems within a city. Anyone can report and track problems they see in their neighborhood and potentially discover a solution by working with others who share their concerns.

## Technologies Used
* React Native
* AirBnB Google Maps for React Native
* Node.js
* PostgreSQL
* JavaScript

## Features
This.City is a native application that allows its users to pin problems to a map. Once pinned, others can see the issue and confirm or deny that it is a problem. Issues can be categorized by type and a description can be attached to the report. These features make up the MVP that creates a healthy, citizen-driven ecosystem for the maintenance and betterment of any community.

## Future Development
1. Create a "profile" page where a user can track all issues they have created or interacted with.
2. Create an "analytics" page where a user can see the most common problems around them as well as sort and filter results.
3. Build social features that enable users to connect with one another to solve a problem.
4. Build social features that enable users to pledge financial support if a problem is solved (Uber/Lyft style exchange).
5. Incorporate photos into app, including uploading photos via a mobile device.
6. Build a system that allows users to close issues and/or that closes issues automatically based on certain criteria.
